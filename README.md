## 1 - PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    
    This project will begin with a function to filter warlord traits and relics for armies in Warhammer 40k.

    This will allow me to build a user interface and create the basics. I will then implement a stratagem
    function where users will be able to filter the stratagems they have available by army, units and phase.

## 2 - USED LANGUAGE AND TECHS

    I will start the project with using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jinga, SQL and Python in a flask environment. The tools might change along the way.

    I am also strongly considering involving a framework like boostrap to facilitate the design of the interface.

## 3 - MAIN FEATURES

    3.1 - Filter and display relics by army
    3.2 - Filter and display warlord traits by army
    3.3 - Filter and display datacards by army
    3.4 - Filter and display datacards by units
    3.5 - Filter and display datacards by round

## 4 - ADDITIONAL DESIRED FEATURES

    4.1 - Add templates that user can create with their selection of relics and warlord traits.
    4.2 - Add a function to filter relics, warlord traits and available stratagems by scanning a Battlescribe list.
